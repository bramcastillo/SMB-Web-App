# Admin web application for small stores

This project consists in a cashier/admin interface for the management of small stores, it's written using PHP, JavaScript, a MySQL database and the MaterializeCSS framework for the styles. It was my first big project, so it's not perfect but hey, one step at a time! ;)

### Principal features
  • Basic cashier functions: add items, visualize a total amount and register/print a receipt
  
  • Visualize all receipts and cancel them if necessary
  
  • A calendar to set appointments or events
  
  • Admin user can register/modify/delete items
  
  • See inventory receipts and issues
  
  • Suppliers and costumers info
  
  
If you want to access to both interfaces (cashier/admin) you'll need to import the .sql file and use this login info:

  ○ Admin
  
    user: adm
    
    pass: 123
    
    
  ○ Cashier
  
    user: caja
    
    pass: caja
